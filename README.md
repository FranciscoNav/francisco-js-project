### Welcome to Francisco Meme Emporium

The primary purpose of this website is display a meme every time a user clicks on the name of a meme. This is accomplished by using an external API to download a list of meme names, and the associated url image. The list of meme names is automatically loaded onto the page when it loads. When a user clicks on a meme name the associated url image is displayed. The user can hide the image by click on the meme name again. 

I also added a like button with a heart icon, so the user can mark their favorite memes when they are looking at the list. The heart icon turns read when clicked and gray when it is un-clicked.
